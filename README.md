# React LNL

## Setup

After cloning this repository, run `yarn install` then `yarn run build`. This should download all
dependencies and compile the react app. The output is in a folder called `/dist`.

## Serving

Unless you want to write a full-fledged nodeJS webserver, I suggest installing a simple server that
can run in a directory. I suggest `http-server` (https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), but
you do you!

Whatever your choice, serve the contents of `/dist`.
